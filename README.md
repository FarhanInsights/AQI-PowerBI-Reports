# Air Quality Analysis of Indian Cities

This project aims to analyze the air quality of various cities in India using a dataset containing information about multiple pollutants and Air Quality Index (AQI) categories. The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and key insights related to air quality levels across different cities.

## Project Overview
Air pollution is a major issue impacting the health and well-being of citizens in India. This project analyzes air quality levels in various cities using key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and others. The dataset also provides the AQI, which categorizes air quality into buckets like Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:
- **City**: Name of the city
- **Date**: Recorded date
- **PM2.5**: Concentration of particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less
- **PM10**: Concentration of particulate matter 10 micrometers or less
- **NO**: Nitric oxide concentration
- **NO2**: Nitrogen dioxide concentration
- **NOx**: Nitrogen oxides concentration
- **NH3**: Ammonia concentration
- **CO**: Carbon monoxide concentration
- **SO2**: Sulfur dioxide concentration
- **O3**: Ozone concentration
- **Benzene**: Benzene concentration
- **Toluene**: Toluene concentration
- **Xylene**: Xylene concentration
- **AQI**: Air Quality Index
- **AQI_Bucket**: Categorization of AQI (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor)

## Project Objectives
- Analyze air quality trends and patterns in different Indian cities.
- Identify the relationship between various pollutants and AQI.
- Visualize air quality variations over time and space.
- Provide insights for data-driven decision-making regarding air pollution.

## Data Analysis and Visualizations
We performed several analyses and created visualizations to gain insights from the dataset:
1. **Time Series Analysis**: Trends of key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, and AQI over time for different cities.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between pollutants such as PM2.5, NO2, SO2, etc.
3. **City-wise and Seasonal Analysis**: Distribution of AQI categories across cities and seasons.
4. **Geographical Mapping**: Visualization of AQI levels using a geographical map.
5. **Category-wise Distribution**: Representation of cities in different AQI categories using sunburst or pie charts.
